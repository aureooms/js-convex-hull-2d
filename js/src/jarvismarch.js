 * One of the simplest (although not the most time efficient in the worst case)
 * planar algorithms. Discovered independently by Chand & Kapur in 1970 and
 * R. A. Jarvis in 1973. It has O(nh) time complexity, where n is the number of
 * points in the set, and h is the number of points in the hull. In the worst
 * case the complexity is Θ(n^2).

	/**
	 * The idea is to wrap the set of points. The technique is the following.
	 *
	 * You first select a vertex for which you are sure that it is part of the
	 * convex hull. For example you can choose the vertex that is first in
	 * lexicographical order over the coordinates in two dimensions, i.e. find
	 * all vertices that have the smallest x coordinate and if there is more
	 * than one then keep only the one with the smallest y coordinate.
	 *
	 * From this selected vertex you compute the next one. The next one is
	 * defined as the one that comes after in clockwise order.
	 *
	 *    |
	 *    |     In this example u is the selected vertex and v the next one.
	 *    |     v is such that there is no vertex w with sin( u , v , w ) < 0
	 *    u     i.e. lying on the right of uv because otherwise u was not
	 *     \    part of the hull in the first place.
	 *      v
	 *
	 * To solve the problem completely we simply iterate over all successive uv
	 * pairs ( we replace u with v after each iteration ). We stop when we made
	 * the complete loop around the set of vertices, i.e when the next v is the
	 * very first u.
	 *
	 *
	 * Hypotheses:
	 *   - |set| >= 2
	 *   - set[0] must be part of the hull ( if |set| = 2 this is the
	 *   only thing you have to do )
	 *
	 * @param {array} set is the input vertex set
	 * @param {array} hull is the ouput hull, we omit to add set[0] voluntarily
